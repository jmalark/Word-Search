# Word-Search
A word search game I created for Computer Science II


To run: python3 wordsearch.py width height

Where width and height will determine the size of the puzzle generated. Once the puzzle has been printed to the terminal, the user can enter words they've found and the program will print out whether the word is valid. When the user quits, they are told how many words they found out of the total possible words in the puzzle and are then given a list of all of the words they did not manage to find.
